## Base

### Description

The first assignment is to create the caster base.  The base's dimensions are 200 mm x 120 mm and 8 mm thick.  It has 6 holes 10 mm wide and 20 mm from the edge equally spaced along the edges.

### Reflection

This was my first Onshape part and [following along with Dr. Shields made it super easy.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=93BFUD-HAG8&feature=emb_title&scrlybrkr=5670f0b4)  I learned about 
* sketching (shortcut **shift-s**)
* constructions lines (shortcut **Q**)
* dimensions (shortcut **D**)
* extruding both add and remove (shortcut key **E**)
* linear patterns (no shortcut)

Onshape is awesome.  I found it really helpful to rename all my sketches.  It is going to be a GREAT year in engineering.

## Axle, Collar, and Bearings

### Description

My sixth assignment has me building my Axle, Collar, and Bearings
#### Axle
1. My first step was to create the main sketch wich had 2 circles one had 10mm and the other had 6mm. 
2. My first extrude required the main sketch and a symmetric 60mm extrude. 
3. Next I created a horizantal line using the main sketches out circle witch was 4.5mm away from the origin.
4. My next extrude I remove 10mm using the line I had created from the second sketch.
5. Now last I had to mirror the 2nd extrude with the Front plain.
#### Collar

#### Bearings
